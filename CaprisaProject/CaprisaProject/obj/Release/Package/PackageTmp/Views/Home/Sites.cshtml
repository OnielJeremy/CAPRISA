                The Springfield CAPRISA Research Clinic at the 
                King Dinizulu Hospital, which is the largest TB
                referral hospital in the province of KwaZulu-Natal.
                As several hundred patients with drug resistant TB
                are treated at this hospital each year, CAPRISA's
                research here focuses on clinical studies on MDR-TB
                and XDR-TB.

                local community to study new approaches to HIV 
                prevention and treatment.
